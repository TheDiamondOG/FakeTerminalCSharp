# FakeTerminal (C# Port)
The original FakeTerminal is at https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/FakeTerminal

The main reason this version exists is to make it so computers without python can use the app. If this does not work on the school computer I am going to make a rust port.

Addon example: https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/FakeTerminalCSharp/blob/master/FakeTerminal/AddonCodeExample/addon_example.cs
